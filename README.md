- 🖐🏼 Ciao, I’m Ari!
- 🎓 I’m a PhD student in behavioural ecology of parasitoid wasps at Stirling University.
- 🐝 I’m interested in reproductive conflicts between the sexes and their repercussion on population dynamics and species interactions.
- 🎨 If I am not in the lab, I have fun illustrating what I study!  
- 📫 Reach me on Twitter @ChitiArianna.
