- 🖐🏼 Ciao, I’m Ari!
- 🎓 I’m a PhD student at the University of Stirling on the behavioural ecology of parasitoid wasps.
- 🐝 I’m interested in sexual selection, with a particular bias for sexual conflict and its consequences on population dynamics.
- 🎨 If I am not in the lab, I have fun illustrating what I study!  
- 📫 Reach me on Twitter @ChitiArianna.
